# kibana maps offline

In this folder, you should put the files that will be attached locally.
The files will be placed in the offline_maps/maptiles folder, and thus will be displayed in Kibana in offline mode.
They will have a volume for the `maptiler` container.

The `maptiles` folder must contain the items of the folder to be transferred and contain:
`fonts` folder,
`maps` folder,
`.json` and `.mbtiles` files.
